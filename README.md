# 3D-FPS-Maze-Shooter
ECE243 Course Project

Using 3D raycasting, my partner and I created a 3D FPS shooter game, where you can use the controls to go and face enemies. By shooting a certain number of enemies, you will win, but if you get hit or run out of time, you lose!

Using C, we implemented the video buffer for graphics, used the VGA display for graphics, and a PS/2 keyboard for control and movement.

Here is a demo video to watch: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1d2pmxF1ytb_-9g2ag3snK9yh1VIfXXYu/view
